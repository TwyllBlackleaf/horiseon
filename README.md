## The Project

Horiseon is an SEO company wanting to make their company website more accessible to screenreaders and more prominent in search results.

## The Website

<https://twyllblackleaf.github.io/horiseon/>

## What I Did

- Made the website's HTML more navigable for screenreaders.
- Tidied up the website's CSS styles to eliminate redundancy and improve legibility.

## How I Did It

- Changed `<div>`s into meaningful semantic HTML elements such as `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<header>`.
- Added alt text to images.
- Edited the CSS to reflect the new elements.
- Removed redundant CSS classes and applied them to specific elements within their parent classes instead.
- Rearranged CSS document and added table of contents and comments for clarity.
