# Horiseon
A code-refactoring project for a company website

## What I Did

- Made the website more navigable for screenreaders
- Tidied up the website's CSS styles to eliminate redundancy

## How I Did It

- Changed `<div>`s into meaningful semantic HTML elements such as `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<header>`.
- Edited the CSS to reflect the new elements.
- Removed redundant CSS classes and applied them to specific elements within their parent classes instead.
